Best choice: SPA with React frontend + Django REST API backend

Optional upgrades: GraphQL if you want optimized queries or future mobile apps.

Hybrid approach: Start with Django templates + AJAX, then gradually migrate to React SPA if needed.

[User Action] → [React / JS Component] → [API call / AJAX] → [Django Server] → [DB / Logic] → [JSON Response] → [React / JS updates UI]




Step 1️⃣: Complete Auth Integration

Wrap the app in AuthProvider (we just did that).

Update Login and Register components to use AuthContext:

On successful login/register, call login(userData) to update global state.

Anywhere in the app, you can now check user to show/hide buttons or data.

Step 2️⃣: Migrate Article List

Replace your article.js DOM rendering with React components:

ArticleList → fetches articles from /api/articles/.

ArticleItem → displays title, author, tags, like button.

CommentSection → displays comments and handles adding new ones.

Use Context API to check login status before allowing likes/comments.

Step 3️⃣: Implement Likes & Comments via API

Update your Django backend to return JSON for likes and comments:

/article/<id>/like/ → toggles like and returns { liked, likes }

/article/<id>/comment/ → adds comment and returns { comment, user }

React components will call these APIs and update UI instantly.

Step 4️⃣: Migrate Article CRUD

Create ArticleForm component for add/edit articles.

Create DraftList component for draft articles.

Connect these to Django API endpoints for POST/PUT/DELETE.

Step 5️⃣: Search & Pagination

Create SearchBar component.

On submit, call /api/articles/?search=keyword.

React handles page changes by fetching the correct page from API.

Step 6️⃣: Replace Django Templates Gradually

Once React handles all UI:

Remove article.html, login.html, register.html, add_article.html, draft_article.html.

Django becomes API-only backend, React SPA handles everything.

Step 7️⃣: Optional Upgrades

Add GraphQL for optimized queries (nested data, less over-fetching).

Add React Router for SPA routing (/login, /articles, /drafts).

Add Redux if your global state grows complex (likes, comments, user, notifications).
